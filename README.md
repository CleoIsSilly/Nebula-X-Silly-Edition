Hiii :3 i diddnt make this repo, i forked it from the original nebula and created 2 sites off of the ultraviolet web proxy system and i used the html from the nebula x site repo to hot these sites
The sites you can use are :
https://nebula-x-site.vercel.app/
https://cleoissilly.github.io/Nebula-X-site/
I plan on reworking nebula x to make it sort of my own.
If you have any questions details, or want to work on it with me , my discord is :
